# Search.Engine.Python
This Python project is a search engine that crawls Reddit posts and ranks them using the PageRank algorithm. I used reddit topics that were of relevance to myself and my friends, which made it a fun project to take on. The goal is to provide an example of web crawling, data processing, and search ranking.

Features:

Crawls Reddit Posts: Extracts posts and comments from specified subreddits.
PageRank Algorithm: Ranks posts based on their relevance and importance.
Search Functionality: Allows users to search for posts and view ranked results.
Requirements:

PRAW (Reddit API) to crawl
BeautifulSoup to parse HTML content
Multiprocessing library to crawl multiple subreddits at once
Data Indexer (PyLucene)
Web Page Hoster (Django)
Database
